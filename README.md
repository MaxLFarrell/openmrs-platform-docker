# OpenMRS Platform Docker

> Docker containers for [OpenMRS](http://openmrs.org) Platform

This repository contains the necessary infrastructure code and related resources
required to compose and run Docker containers that start an instance
of the OpenMRS Platform.

For more information about the OpenMRS Platform visit [openmrs.org](http://www.openmrs.org/).

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed.

## Setup

Start by cloning this repository:

````
git clone https://github.com/psbrandt/openmrs-platform-docker.git
````

Enter the directory and build the images:

````
cd openmrs-platform-docker
docker-compose build
````

Once the build is complete, you'll have to make sure that the mysql container
is initialized due to [this limitation](https://github.com/docker-library/mysql/issues/81).
Do this by running the following:

````
docker-compose up openmrs-platform-mysql
````

When it's done you can press `ctrl+c` to stop the container. You will only have
to do this the first time.

After this you can run the OpenMRS Platform by executing the following:

````
docker-compose up
````

## Access

To log into OpenMRS Platform, use the following details:

* **Host**: `DOCKER_HOST:8080/openmrs`
* **User**: admin
* **Pass**: Admin123

## Troubleshooting

> Could not create connection to database server. Attempted reconnect 3 times. Giving up.

Since it's not currently possible to order the startup of Docker containers,
sometimes the Tomcat container will start before the MySQL container. As a result,
OpenMRS might not get a database connection on start up. To work around this,
stop the containers and restart them:

````
docker-compose stop
docker-compose start
````
